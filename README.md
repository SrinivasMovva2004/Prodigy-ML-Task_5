Food Recognition and Calorie Estimation Model
This repository contains code for a deep learning model that can accurately recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content. This enables users to track their dietary intake, make informed food choices, and manage their nutrition effectively.

Overview:
The model leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for food recognition and a regression model for estimating calorie content based on recognized food items. It processes input images containing food items and provides outputs that include the recognized food category and estimated calorie count.

Key Features:
Food Recognition: Identifies various food items from images using deep learning techniques.
Calorie Estimation: Estimates the calorie content of recognized food items to provide nutritional information.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides a simple interface for users to upload images, receive food recognition results, and view estimated calories.
Extensibility: Easily extendable to recognize additional food categories with more training data.
Accuracy: Achieves high accuracy in recognizing common food items and estimating their calorie content.

Installation:
Prerequisites:
Python (version >= 3.6)
TensorFlow (version >= 2.0)
OpenCV (for image processing)
NumPy (for numerical operations)
Flask (for creating web application)
(Optional) GPU support for faster training (recommended)

Model Architecture:
Describe your model architectures here, including details such as layers, activation functions, and any special considerations for both the food recognition and calorie estimation models.

Dataset:
Describe the dataset used for training, including the number of classes (food categories), total number of samples, and any preprocessing steps applied (e.g., resizing images, normalization).

Results:
Include information about the performance metrics achieved by your models, such as accuracy for food recognition and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for calorie estimation.
